# Audible Visuals
## Audio visualizer created with THREE.js and Web Audio API
---
### Summary
Drag and drop a song from your computer and visualize the tunes. Visualizations are created by analyzing the waveform and frequency data thorugh the Web Audio API and then rendered in canvas with THREE.js. In this version there is a navigation bar that allows you to experiment with some of the older visualizers I made (sqaure, sphere, waveform, and lines). Within the main landing page (spiral) there are four different visualizers featuring a variety of geometric manipulation (spiral, wavy spiral, flower, circle) that can be toggled seamlessly while playing a song, as well as three different color schemes.  
  
Play around!! It's mind blowing how visually different songs can be.
